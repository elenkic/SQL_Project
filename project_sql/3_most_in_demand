Question: what are the most in-demand skills for data analyst?
- join job postings to inner join table similar to query 2
- identify the top 5 in-demand skills for a data analyst
- focus on all job postings so not just remote
- we need the count of skills

/*
COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id)

    SQL counts every non-NULL row in the column job_id.

    Since every row in skills_job_dim has both a job_id and a skill_id, COUNT(job_id) = COUNT(skill_id).

✅ So in this case, it doesn’t matter which one you use — the counts are identical.

Which is better?

Conceptually: you are counting how many job-skill links exist per skill.

Using COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) is slightly more descriptive because your measure is “demand per skill” (how many jobs require this skill).

Using COUNT(skill_id) would also work — same result — but it’s less intuitive when thinking about job demand.
